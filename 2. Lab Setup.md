- create keys on ubuntu-c using `ssh-keygen`
- copy the content of public-key to authorized_keys file on remote system
    - if we are doing it manually, check the permissions of authorized_keys file and .ssh directory.
    - the efficient way to use ssh-copy-id tool `ssh-copy-id ansible@ubuntu1` i.e. `ssh-copy-id username@remotesystem`
- now we want to copy the public key from our ansible host (ubuntu-c) to all our target systems (ubuntu1, ubuntu2, ubuntu3, cebtos1, centos2, centos3) as both ansible and root user.
    - we can manually run `ssh-copy-id username@remotesystem` command and provide password of each target.
    - or we can automate it as follows:
