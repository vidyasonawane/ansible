## Introduction
- Ansible is Open source configuration management software provisioning and application deployment toolset
- created by Michael DeHann in 2012.
- It was later acquired by Red Hat, Inc in 2015 and since then Red Hat, Inc and the Open Source community have further developed and improved the platform.

- **modules:** 
    - major factor in the success of Ansible is the extensive library of modules that are openly available for consumption
    - There are modules that cover many areas including Cloud Computing, Networking, Server Configuration and Management, Virtualization, Containerization and more.

- **Ansible executable:** 
    - A highly versatile tool that acts as a swiss army knife for your automation requirements
    - typing ansible, at apromt where Ansible is installed.
    - great for initially setting up a project and testing our ansible configuration.
    - easy to use, with ansible modules.
    - easy to use, with ansible target infrastructure.

- **Ansible Playbook:**
    - through the use of the ansible-playbook executable it allows you to work with Ansible's human readable configuration, deployment and orchestration language
    - A playbook is as the name implies, a book of plays with a play depicting the configuration and changes that you would like to achieve against a given set of targets 
    - a playbook can comprise of a simple set of tasks to advance configurations leveraging Ansible features such as rolling updates parallel execution and roles.

- **Inventories:**
    - Inventories are a **collection of targets most commonly comprise of hosts** but can also relate to other components such as network switches, containers, storage arrays or other physical and virtual components that we wish to interact with through Ansible.
    - Inventory, also provides useful information that we can use alongside our targets during the Ansible execution
    - Inventories can be quite simple where they are a text file with a selection of targets
    - there's also the ability to create Dynamic Inventories where the inventory is an executable with the data being sourced dynamically This opens up a lot of flexibility where we store our data elsewhere and make use of it at runtime
