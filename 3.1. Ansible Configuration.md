**Ansible Configuration**

- Ansible can make use of an associated configuration file where it will make reference to this configuration file with regards to 
    - how Ansible should operate and 
    - the resources that it uses.

- We're going to start this off on our ansible control host, ubuntu-c.
    - run the command `ansible --version`
    output:
    ```
        ansible [core 2.11.2] 
        config file = None
        configured module search path = ['/home/ansible/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
        ansible python module location = /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/ansible
        ansible collection location = /home/ansible/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections
        executable location = /usr/local/bin/ansible
        python version = 3.8.5 (default, May 27 2021, 13:30:53) [GCC 9.3.0]
        jinja version = 3.0.1
        libyaml = True
    ```
    - here config file = None

- The lowest of the priority is the /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg configuration file. this location is typically used when Ansible is installed via a system installation. for example, on Ubuntu, if you use then `apt install ansible` or if you were using a cantos by doing a `yum install ansible`.
    - switch to root user `su - `
    - create directory `mkdir /etc/ansible`
    - use `touch` command to create zero length file. `touch /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`
    - `exit` - back to ansible user
    - use `ansible --version` and see the output.
    - ```
        ansible [core 2.11.2] 
        config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
        configured module search path = ['/home/ansible/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
        ansible python module location = /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/ansible
        ansible collection location = /home/ansible/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections
        executable location = /usr/local/bin/ansible
        python version = 3.8.5 (default, May 27 2021, 13:30:53) [GCC 9.3.0]
        jinja version = 3.0.1
        libyaml = True
        ```
    - config file path is updated.

- the next highest priority is a hidden file called `.ansible.cfg` in the user's home directory.
    - go to home directory `cd ~` and confirm using `pwd`
    - create hidden file using touch `touch .ansible.cfg`
    - run `ansible --version`
    - ```
        ansible [core 2.11.2] 
        config file = /home/ansible/.ansible.cfg
        configured module search path = ['/home/ansible/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
        ansible python module location = /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/ansible
        ansible collection location = /home/ansible/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections
        executable location = /usr/local/bin/ansible
        python version = 3.8.5 (default, May 27 2021, 13:30:53) [GCC 9.3.0]
        jinja version = 3.0.1
        libyaml = True
        ```
    - now you can see the config file path is updated to hidden file. because this file has a higher priority than the one that we actually saw previously.
    - As long as we're logged in as this user, this will be the configuration file Ansible will use.

- Next up is `./ansible.cfg` file which is in the current directory.
    - it enables you to have your related ansible configuration alongside your ansible execution, an all encompassing as one entity, we make use of this throughout the entire course.
    - ansible repository is built on this logic where we have individual directories and each of them have their own ansible.cfg file.
    - `mkdir testdir`
    - `cd testdir`
    - `touch ansible.cfg`
    - `ansible --version`
    - ```
        ansible [core 2.11.2] 
        config file = /home/ansible/testdir/ansible.cfg
        configured module search path = ['/home/ansible/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
        ansible python module location = /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/ansible
        ansible collection location = /home/ansible/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections
        executable location = /usr/local/bin/ansible
        python version = 3.8.5 (default, May 27 2021, 13:30:53) [GCC 9.3.0]
        jinja version = 3.0.1
        libyaml = True
        ```

- the number one precedence is the `ANSIBLE_CONFIG` environment variable.
    - create example_ansible.cfg configuration file. (we can give any name to this file). `touch this_is_my_example_ansible.cfg`
    - `export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/home/ansible/this_is_my_example_ansible.cfg`
    - `ansible --version`
     ```
        ansible [core 2.11.2] 
        config file = /home/ansible/this_is_my_example_ansible.cfg
        configured module search path = ['/home/ansible/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
        ansible python module location = /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/ansible
        ansible collection location = /home/ansible/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections
        executable location = /usr/local/bin/ansible
        python version = 3.8.5 (default, May 27 2021, 13:30:53) [GCC 9.3.0]
        jinja version = 3.0.1
        libyaml = True
    ```
